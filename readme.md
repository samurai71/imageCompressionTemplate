# Gulp imagemin to minify images template

Created a template file just for minifying images using imagmin and gulp and it watches that folder as well.

## Getting Started

You must have nodejs installed. Download the repo and type in npm install, when that is complete then type in gulp and it will work. There are no images in the directory so if you want it to compress images must be put in the img folder.

### Prerequisites

nodejs and gulp must be installed

### Installing

Download the repo into a folder on your hard drive, then change into that directory/folder. Open up a terminal window and type in npm install, and it will install the plugins used for this project.

## Deployment

Copy the compressed images from minified/images and put them into your project as they are not compressed.
